title: Use tomli instead of tomlkit
category: performance
author: Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula <venu@chaoss.community>

notes: >
    tomli is 14x as fast as tomlkit. This change replaces
    existing tomlkit code with the tomli methods. It also
    adds a condition to validate the pyproject.toml file.
